# Tense_Classifier
Developed a Flask-based web application for machine learning. The application incorporates a custom dataset containing sentences and their corresponding tenses, which was utilized to train a logistic regression model. An accuracy of 94% was achieved by the model. Through the web application, a sentence of their choice can be input by users, and its tense can be determined.
